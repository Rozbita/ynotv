/**
 * Portal-side ("server") search for Stalker sources.
 *
 * Stalker VOD browsing is lazy per category, so the local library only ever holds the
 * categories a user has opened — a local search can never cover a 100k-title portal.
 * This asks the portal itself, which is the only way to search the whole catalogue.
 *
 * Results are written through the same mapping the lazy loader uses
 * (`storeStalkerServerSearchHits`), which is what keeps them from duplicating what is
 * already cached: `vodMovies.stream_id` and `vodSeries.series_id` are derived from the
 * portal's own ids, so an already-known title is updated in place. It also means the
 * existing detail page, media-info probe and stream resolver work on a result unchanged.
